# CCETC/BootstrapBundle - README

This is simply a Symfony Bundle that serves as a container for [Twitter's Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/).

The only customization to the Bootstrap code is an additional font stack for Trebuchet.  There is a compiled css file for this custom stack as well as the default compiled css.
